The Doctor Appointment Booking System is a simple yet comprehensive web project designed for e-channeling using PHP, HTML, and CSS. This initiative facilitates online appointment requests for clients or patients of medical establishments, including clinics and hospitals. Additionally, it aids doctors in managing their appointments efficiently.

The system is structured around three key roles: Administrator, Doctor, and Patient. The Administrator manages the list of doctors, their specialties, and their credentials within the system. Patients can browse through the doctor's appointment system, find doctors based on their specialty, review the doctors' weekly schedules, and select a suitable time for their appointments. Doctors, on the other hand, can view all their appointments and manage appointment requests.
